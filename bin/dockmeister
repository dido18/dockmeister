    USAGE
      dockmeister [COMMAND]

    COMMANDS:

    #### compose

    Prepares a composition of each services' `docker-compose.yml` file into a single `docker-compose.yml` file. All `build` and `volume` paths are adjusted to be relative to the root directory.

    #### build

    - Runs the pre-build scripts for each service
    - Builds all docker containers using `docker-compose build`.
    - Runs the post-build scripts for each service

    Pre- and post-build scripts reside in the `scripts/` sub-directory.
    The filenames of the scripts are required to have a `pre` or `post` prefix.
    The scripts will be run from the service folder.

    #### up

    Starts the containers using `docker-compose up`
    eos
end
